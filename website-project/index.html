  <p>This project was started in the summer of 2017 so I could help teach myself how to write CSS, HTML, and javascript. I use the Jekyll framework to automatically generate blog posts, but the styling and layout of the page are customized by me using plain CSS and HTML. Below are some blog posts about the progress of this site.</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>So I ran into a minor (pretty major) issue today. I had originally planned to use GitHub sites to host my website. Jekyll, the framework I’m using to generate this site is developed by the founder of Github, and as a result, GitHub supports Jekyll with some additional features. By using GitHub sites, all one has to do to deploy their Jekyll website is add a repository with their Jekyll code, and enable GitHub sites. GitHub takes care of building and deploying your site, which means you can even edit your site online through GitHub’s text editor without downloading and pushing your code. However, since GitHub is building and deploying your site, you have to make sure all the plugins you are using are supported by GitHub’s build platform.</p>

<p>This is what’s causing my hosting issues.</p>

<p>I did a test launch on GitHub sites and I noticed some of the HTML generate was different from what I had locally. I realized that this was because I’m using the Jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin, not the original Jekyll-paginate plugin. Unfortunately, I actually need the paginate-v2 plugin, since the original plugin is very restrictive and only allows you to have one paginate page whereas I would like a paginate page for each project I’m working on.</p>

<p>I think I have two options going forward.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I can try to see if I can still use GitHub sites to host my site, and just not take advantage of their auto-build and deploy feature.</li>
  <li>I can use a different hosting service.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m not sure what I’ll do yet, but I’m going to start looking into some other hosting services and compare them to Github’s.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I also need a domain name. austinzhang.com is taken, but austinzhang.io and austinmzhang.com are open. I still need to decide.</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>This is officially the first non-test post on my website.</p>

<p>After trying a lot of different frameworks (React, Bootstrap, Django, HTML5 Boilerplate) I finally settled on Jekyll. Here’s why.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The main reason why I decided to use Jekyll for my website project is that it’s a static page generator. I’m not really trying to build a web app, so while frameworks such as Django and react are feature packed, using them for a small personal website would just lead to a bloated site. Jekyll is also faster than these alternatives, as the HTML is pre-generated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secondary reason I decided to use Jekyll over something like just writing a site from scratch with CSS and HTML or a Boilerplate template is that Jekyll makes it really easy for me to update my site. Instead of having to edit HTML and CSS whenever I want to add something to the site, I can just add a separate markdown file. Being able to write new posts without actually writing new code is going to be nice in the long run.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Setting up this site definitely was not as easy as I thought it would be. For one, Jekyll is only with Unix, so to get it to work on my windows laptop, I had to set up a bash shell before I could even get started. Then, I had some issues with package dependencies and a really difficult time troubleshooting paginate features, but I’ve been testing the site for a while and I think it’s finally about where I want it to be.</p>

<p>I decided on a template called <a href="https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll">pixyll</a> to use for the site. I mainly like its clean minimalistic design. There are a few CSS styling aspects I might want to change, such as darkening the navbar a little and maybe applying a color gradient, but nothing too major.</p>

<p>I still have to figure out how I’m going to host this website. I’m probably going to just host it on GitHub sites for free as a personal page, but I might use AWS. We’ll see. Well, I guess I’ll see since nobody else will be reading this until after I have the hosting figured out.</p>
