          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>As a high school senior, I’ve started to look at some of the supplemental essays for different colleges, and one of U Chicago’s prompts caught my eye. The prompt is, <em>“Due to a series of clerical errors, there is exactly one typo (an extra letter, a removed letter, or an altered letter) in the name of every department at the University of Chicago. Oops! Describe your new intended major. Why are you interested in it and what courses or areas of focus within it might you want to explore? Potential options include Commuter Science, Bromance Languages and Literatures, Pundamentals: Issues and Texts, Ant History…”</em> U Chicago is pretty well known for its unconventional prompts, and this prompt is no exception. However, this prompt was particularly interesting because there’s a pretty cool project that can be adapted from it.</p>

<p>I couldn’t think of many departments when I began brainstorming ideas for the essay, which led me to this project idea: an algorithm that scans all the possible word modifications for the majors. It should be a pretty simple project to brute force. For example, the word “Anthropology” is 12 letters long. For the word, you can choose to either insert a letter, delete a letter, or alter a letter. Since there are 12 letters, you have 12 letters to choose from to erase or alter and 13 slots where you could possibly insert a letter. This same pattern applies to all words, so each word has 3n+1 different possible modifications. However, in some of the modifications (inserting or replacing a letter), you also have to choose a letter you want to insert or replace, which adds to the complexity. There are 26 different letters you can insert, and 25 different letters you can replace the current letter with. this brings up the complexity by a large amount, so the total number of different combinations for a word of n length is 25n + 26(n+1) + n. This brings the number of combinations for our “Anthropology” example up to 650. This may seem like a lot of combinations to write out by hand, but it would take a computer less than a second to compute all of the combinations of not only the word Anthropology but of every word in all of the different majors at U Chicago.</p>

<p>Ok, enough background. Let’s start coding.</p>

<p>Although there are a lot of different possible combinations, it’s evident that most of them will be gibberish. That’s why I’ll want to cross check my combinations with an actual dictionary to see whether I have a real word or not. I downloaded a word list from <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/dotnetperls-controls/downloads">here</a> that I’ll use to see if my combination is a real word.</p>

<p>First I’ll input the list into a set (for speed purposes, IO is very slow and it’s horribly inefficient to scan the entire document every time I have a new word)</p>

<p>Now comes the fun part…permutating each word.</p>

<p>This part is actually very easy and can be accomplished with a couple while loops. After permutating the word, I check it against an English word list and if it’s a real word, I store the result and original word in a key-map pair.</p>

<p>After all the different permutations have been tested I spit out the result map to a text document.</p>

<p>Now to actually see what words majors there were I had to type out all of the majors into a text document. This was definitely the worst part.</p>

<p>So once I finished writing the program, I ran it (runtime is &lt; 1sec) and found that in total, with all the majors/concentrations/etc. listed on U Chicago’s site, there are 663 different possible things you could write your topic on. This was actually a lot more than I expected, but keep in mind that the majority of these different possibilities are nonsensical.</p>

<p>As a closing note, although this program finds all the possible English permutations of the words in the U Chicago majors, it doesn’t consider “punny” words to be real words (ex. Pundamentals). So we are assuredly missing out on a section of the possible prompts.</p>

          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>Our electric skateboard design is near finalization. The ESC case and battery case are finished and seem pretty sturdy. Now, the only thing we still need to workout is a transmitter/remote and a battery solution. 
Currently, we’re using an <a href="https://hobbyking.com/en_us/hobbykingr-tmhk-gt2b-3ch-2-4ghz-transmitter-and-receiver-w-rechargable-li-ion-battery-1.html">HK-GT2B</a> transmitter/receiver combo meant for an RC car that’s rehoused in a 3d printed remote case we found on Thingiverse. While this works fine, the rehousing process for the remote is a little difficult and involves some soldering and cutting to make the bulky RC controller components fit in the small controller. If we were to sell kits for our skateboard, I’d feel better with including a premade controller or at least a controller that’s easier to assemble. We could either buy a specialized transmitter/receiver combo or build our own with an Arduino. I think the first option would probably be better. 
Another issue that we’ve yet to resolve is our battery system. Currently, we’re using Lipo batteries that we charge with a balance charger, but if we’re going to commercialize our board, we probably don’t want to use a balance charger that takes time to set up before each charge. Plug and go would be the best. This problem is easily fixed; all we need is a BMS (Battery Management System). We’d plug the balance leads on our Lipo batteries to the BMS and wire the BMS to a port where we can connect a 25.2-volt charger. The BMS would automatically balance our batteries for us.
The larger battery system problem has to do with the batteries themselves. While Lipo batteries have a very high energy density, the main issue is their short cycle times and instability. Lipo batteries can last for around 400-500 cycles while more stable lithium chemistries, such as LiFePO4 can last up to 2000 cycles.
Another issue, the main issue, is that lipo batteries are a safety concern. Lithium polymer is one of the most unstable lithium battery chemistries, and can easily explode when overcharged or overdischarged.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of a lipo explosion.</p>

<p>Now we won’t be shooting BBs at our batteries and they should be protected from rocks and curbs by our battery case, but there’s a fair bit of vibration while riding the skateboard and we really don’t want to be taking any chances. Currently, our battery case is padded, but we’d prefer to work with more safe batteries. We started to experiment with building our own battery pack using 18650 li-ion cells, but that failed terribly and is for another post.</p>

<p>One last thing that I’ve been thinking about is the motor mount. Both the retaining piece and the motor mount itself can be thinner, and we might even be able to explore reintroducing our two-piece mount. The problem with our original two-piece mount was bending due to the high torque of the motor, but that was before we had the retaining brace. I think the retaining brace takes a significant load off the motor mount and might be enough to allow us to reintroduce some of our previously rejected thinner mount designs.</p>

<p>Most of what I’ve been writing doesn’t make any sense without photos, so I’ll include a few down below.</p>

<p>A full view of the bottom of the skateboard. The orange box is the battery case, the blue box is the ESC and receiver, the blue thing attached to the trucks at the top of the picture is the motor mount, and the yellow thing attached to the trucks is the retaining piece.

<p>A top view of our board. Although there are small points where the screws used to attach the ESC and Battery cases stick out past the grip tape, they’re cut to length so they don’t actually stick out of the board.

<p>Inside our ESC case. At the top is the receiver, and the main piece is the ESC. The translucent material around the outside is hot glue that we were using to waterproof the ESC. We switched to sealant meant specifically for waterproofing after this picture.

<p>Our remote control. This is the only piece we didn’t design ourselves besides the 3D printed pulley we used for our drive wheel. The file can be found <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:922378">here</a>. We plan on replacing this controller soon.

<p>A close up of our motor mount. Note the ridges protruding out of the motor mount; these provide more rigidity and help reduce flexing. The mount is secured using threaded rod to a retaining piece mounted on the truck to hold it in place and to reduce torque on the mount.

          <a href="/netsnek-project-post/2017/07/05/Networking-issues/" class="post-link"><h3 class="h1 post-title">Networking issues</h3></a>
          <span class="post-summary">
            
              <p>One of the issues that has been really difficult for me to solve with this project is coming up with a good networking protocol. In netsnek, there are servers and players. The game is snake/tron, so the only major information players need to receive from the server is the location of other players. The only major information the server needs to receive from the player is the direction in which the player wants to move. There’s some other info like leaderboards and when the game starts but that’s unrelated to my issue.</p>

<p>My issue is that when sending all the player/server data, either not all of the data is getting through, or the data is getting through too slowly (there’s a lot of lag). This issue pertains to sending and receiving directional/map data between the server and player because as the number of players goes up, the amount of network traffic caused by this communication also increases significantly. My network protocol needs to be reliable, lightweight, and fast.</p>

<p>Here are some things I’ve tried.</p>

<p>My first network protocol was to just send the players the entire map from the server, with the locations of every single snake, every single frame. This, of course, is highly inefficient, but because of the redundant information, it’s not that big of a deal if a packet isn’t received, the user’s display will still update properly when the next packet is sent a fraction of a second later. The issue with this approach is lag. With one or two players, this approach works well, but when you scale up to 5-6 players, the lag starts to become very noticeable. This is because as the number of players increase, not only are you broadcasting more transmissions for each of the new players, you’re also broadcasting larger transmissions, as the size of the map increases proportionally with the number of players. Therefore lag increases quadratically with the number of players, and in a fast-paced game like snake, lag makes the game almost unplayable.</p>

<p>My next and current approach at the time of writing this post was to only update pieces of the map that changed. The server would save the state of the map at the last broadcast and would compare the current state to the state at the last broadcast. If there were differences in any points of the map, the server would then send those differences to the players, and the players would update their screens accordingly.</p>

<p>This approach worked well in solving the lag problem; the game can now support its max of 9 players without any noticeable lag. However, it caused a separate issue. Sometimes not all of the packets would go through, and when this happened, the failed broadcasts would create gaps in the player maps. It caused situations where players would think that squares were empty, but there were actually snake pieces there. I’m not really sure why this is happening, the java socket class uses the TCP protocol, which theoretically ensures the delivery of practically every packet. I think the issue might not be related to the transmission of the packets, but to the reception. I’m using Inputstreamreaders to receive the data so I theorized that the dropped packets could be caused by a buffer overflow on the player end.</p>

<p>To test this theory, I created a separate thread to empty the player buffer and place data into a separate queue as soon as it’s received. This way, I could be sure that there’s no buffer pileup caused by the main thread waiting on the GUI to draw. However, even after making sure that the buffers weren’t filling up, I still had some lost packets.</p>

<p>I think the next approach I’m going to try is a combination of the first two ideas. I’m only going to be transmitting the data for movements that need to be updated, but I’ll transmit that data a few times to ensure the message goes through. I’ll also combine transmissions. Right now, I update each coordinate independently, so basically if 4 snakes move in a frame, I send 4 different packets with snake locations. This makes the packets small but does create a lot of packets. It might help if I combine these transmissions all into a single broadcast. I hope this method works because I really want to work on a different part of the project like the GUI and settings.</p>

<p>I’ll keep you posted on the results.</p>
